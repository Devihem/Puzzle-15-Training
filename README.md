📑 **About:**

*‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ This is a self training project in python, based on not the unknown puzzle 15. The original puzzle is a sliding puzzle which has 15 square tiles numbered 1 to 15 in a frame that is with size 4x4 .Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order from left to right, top to bottom. The interesting part about the puzzle is that if the board is randomly arranged is not always solvable. To understand if the new generated/created puzzle is solvable, certain rules must be followed in dependency from the size of the board and number inversions.*

*‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ Checking if the puzzle is solvable is only the first part. After that different options , modes and assistant are added. The gaming-board can be with custom size, everything is scalable without hard-coding any part of the code.*
